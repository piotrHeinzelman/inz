Creating Bag-Of-Features.
-------------------------
* Image category 1: 0
* Image category 2: 1
* Selecting feature point locations using the Grid method.
* Extracting SURF features from the selected feature point locations.
** The GridStep is [8 8] and the BlockWidth is [32 64 96 128].

* Extracting features from 1600 images...done. Extracted 5760000 features.

* Keeping 80 percent of the strongest features from each category.

* Creating a 500 word visual vocabulary.
* Number of levels: 1
* Branching factor: 500
* Number of clustering steps: 1

* [Step 1/1] Clustering vocabulary level 1.
* Number of features          : 4608000
* Number of clusters          : 500
* Initializing cluster centers...100.00%.
* Clustering...completed 66/100 iterations (~10.12 seconds/iteration)...converged in 66 iterations.

* Finished creating Bag-Of-Features
