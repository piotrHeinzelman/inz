Windows 10 NVIDIA GPU Python
To set up a Windows 10 machine with an NVIDIA GPU for Python programming, follow these steps:

Install NVIDIA Drivers: Ensure that your NVIDIA drivers are up to date. You can download the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website.

Create a Python Environment: Use Anaconda to create a new environment for your Python projects. For example, you can create an environment named deeplearning with Python 3.5 using the command:
conda create --name deeplearning python=3.5

Activate the environment with:
conda activate deeplearning

Install TensorFlow or PyTorch: Install TensorFlow or PyTorch with GPU support. For TensorFlow, you can install the GPU version using:
pip install tensorflow-gpu

For PyTorch, use:
pip install torch torchvision

Verify GPU Usage: To ensure that TensorFlow or PyTorch is using the GPU, you can run a simple script to check GPU availability. For TensorFlow, you can use:
import tensorflow as tf
print("Is GPU available?", tf.test.is_gpu_available())

For PyTorch, you can use:
import torch
print("Is CUDA available?", torch.cuda.is_available())

Additional Tools: Install additional tools like Numba, which can compile Python code for execution on CUDA-capable GPUs, and PyCUDA for more direct CUDA programming.
By following these steps, you can set up your Windows 10 machine with an NVIDIA GPU to perform GPU-accelerated Python programming.
