- The cuda binaries are in /opt/cuda/bin/
- The cuda samples are in /opt/cuda/samples/
- The cuda docs are in /opt/cuda/doc/
- You need to source /etc/profile or restart your session in order for the CUDA
  binaries to appear in your $PATH
- The default host compiler for nvcc is set by the $NVCC_CCBIN environment
  variable in /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh
- The default host compiler for nvcc is no longer configured using symlinks in
  /opt/cuda/bin/ but by the $NVCC_CCBIN environment variable in
  /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh.  You need to source /etc/profile or restart your
  session for it to be available in your environment.  Additionally, you may
  need to clear the build cache of your projects where the old path may have
  been recorded.
- When you uninstall an old, unrequired version of GCC that was previously
  required by cuda for the default host compiler ($NVCC_CCBIN), you may need
  to source /etc/profile or restart your session.  Additionally, you may need
  to clear the build cache of your projects where the old path may be still
  recorded.
Optional dependencies for cuda
    gdb: for cuda-gdb
    glu: required for some profiling tools in CUPTI [installed]
    nvidia-utils: for NVIDIA drivers (not needed in CDI containers) [installed]
    rdma-core: for GPUDirect Storage (libcufile_rdma.so)
